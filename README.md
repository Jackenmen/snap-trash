If you're interested in installing trash-cli system-wide, what I can personally recommend is using [the pipx project](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).<br>
[When configured appropriately](https://github.com/pypa/pipx/issues/754), it can also be used to install Python packages system-wide.

Another distro-agnostic solution is using [trash-cli Nix package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=trash-cli&size=1&query=trash-cli).

# snap-trash

The `trash` snap package for the [trash-cli project](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli).

The snap build is not endorsed by the author of trash-cli.
